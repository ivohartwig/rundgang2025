#### Objective

You've built things. You've broken things. You've coded, glitched, clicked, blinked, and drawn. Now it's time to reflect and document.

Your task is to create a microsite that archives your projects from this semester: from analog algorithms to blinking lights. This is not just a collection—it's your own web-based exhibition.

#### Your Mission

##### 1. Organize

- Create a project directory for each topic:
algorithm/, interaction/, motion/, perspective/, physical-computing/
- Each subproject must include:
- Working code or demo
- Screenshots, images, or video
- Short written reflection: What did you learn? What worked? What didn't?

##### 2. Structure Your Microsite

- Create a landing page: index.html linking to all projects
- Optional: about.html or reflection.html with your personal thoughts on the semester
- Use folders for /css, /images, /js
- Every page must be navigable—don't leave orphan files

##### 3. Reflect

- Write a short text on what you learned across the semester:
- HTML/CSS fundamentals
- Working with p5.js
- Generative approaches and aesthetics
- Arduino and physical computing
- Be clear and precise. Academic, not poetic. No travel blogs.

⸻

#### Tips

- Use reset.css and base.css to keep styles consistent
- Own your code: if AI helped, make sure you understand what it does
- Use semantic HTML—don't just slap <div>s everywhere
- All links and scripts must work—test locally

#### Deliverables

- A structured archive website hosted via GitHub Pages or handed in as ZIP
- Each project properly documented and working
- A general semester reflection (min. 300 words)
- No slop. No filler. No lorem ipsum.
