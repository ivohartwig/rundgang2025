title: Blinkenlichten
description: A Physical Computing Project about blinking lights using Arduino by classic hacker culture, LEDs, and the art of interaction
---



#### Objective

Design and build an object that uses sensors to detect something from the world—motion, sound, time, distance, heat—and reacts through blinking lights. 
Your device should be visually cohesive, expressive, and mysterious: hide the tech, highlight the effect.


#### Your Mission

##### 1. Exploration & Concept

- Research sensor types and microcontroller basics
- Brainstorm: what can your object sense?
- Think visually: how will it blink, glow, pulse, or flicker?
- Sketch your idea and consider materials

##### 2. Build & Program

- Connect your sensor(s) to an Arduino
- Write code to react to sensor input (start simple)
- Design the enclosure: no visible electronics!
- Iterate on interaction and LED behavior
- Test in semi-darkness: how does it feel?

##### 3. Finalize & Exhibit

- Align with class style (colors, materials, visual theme)
- Film a short video of your object in action
- Prepare for exhibition (label, setup, stability)
- Bring cookies if you want extra credit


#### Tips

- Use analogRead() and digitalWrite() wisely
- Don’t go overboard: one good interaction > ten chaotic ones
- Cable management is half the battle
- Use masking materials (paper, foil, acrylic) to diffuse LEDs
- Debug in small steps (sensor → LED → enclosure)

#### Deliverables

- A working object with reactive light behavior
- A short video demo (1–2 minutes)
- A brief write-up: what does it sense? how does it behave?
- Your code and wiring sketch (in your GitHub repo)
- Your object ready for exhibition
