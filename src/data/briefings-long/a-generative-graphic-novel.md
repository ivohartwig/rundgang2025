title: A Generative Graphic Novel
description: Narratives in the Age of AI
---


#### Objective

  

Create a digital graphic novel that combines storytelling, layout design, and AI-generated imagery. You'll work in small teams to produce a web-based, responsive narrative experience using tools like DALLÂ·E 3, Stable Diffusion, or Midjourney.

The story, length, and style are up to you--but keep your characters and visual language consistent.



#### Your Mission

  

##### 1. Story and Style Development

- Brainstorm story ideas collaboratively
- Define the world, characters, and tone
- Create a consistent visual style with AI image tools
- Consider generating text with LLMs (e.g. GPT) for narrative content or dialogue
- Collect and document all used prompts and styles
- Develop systems and tools to generate matrices and overviews
- Create a visual map of your story flow

  

##### 2. Technical Implementation

- Build a responsive webpage to present your graphic novel
- Use HTML, CSS (FlexBox or Grid), and JavaScript (vanilla or p5.js)
- Integrate and lay out images and texts in a way that supports the story flow
- Consider interaction, animation, or sound if it supports the narrative

  

##### 3. Finalization

- Polish layout and design
- Test on various devices (**phone**, tablet, desktop)
- Make sure navigation is intuitive (scroll, swipe, click)
- Fix layout bugs and inconsistent styles

#### Tips

- Use AI as a _creative partner_--not a vending machine
- Be mindful of bias, stereotypes, and ethical concerns in generative outputs
- Reuse characters and props to build coherence
- Try prompt iteration or inpainting to fine-tune visuals
- Save all your prompts and experiments for documentation



#### Deliverables

- A **responsive** webpage with your graphic novel
- A README.md explaining your story, process, and tools
- A visual map or sketch of your narrative flow (can be a PDF or image)
- A LICENSE file for your project
