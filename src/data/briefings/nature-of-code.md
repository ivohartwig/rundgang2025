title: Excursion into the Nature of Code
description: Based on https://natureofcode.com/ by Daniel Shiffmann
---


We closely observed natural patterns and behaviors—such as animal movement, plant growth, or wave dynamics—during an excursion, focusing on how systems in nature evolve and interact. We documented our observations through notes, sketches, photos, and videos, paying special attention to the underlying rules and emergent phenomena.

After returning, we selected one observation and created a p5.js sketch to simulate the behavior or structure we witnessed, using code as a tool to model and reinterpret natural processes. The project deliverables included a short blog-style documentation with visuals, the simulation code, and a reflection on both our observations and the translation of those patterns into code.

<!-- 

##### 1. Observe

- Spend time in nature.
- Watch how things move, grow, repeat, or interact.
- Focus on patterns that emerge over time or through interaction.

##### 2. Document

- Take notes, sketches, videos, or photos.
- Describe what you see in simple terms (e.g. "many birds change direction together", "branches grow in spirals").
- Think about what rules might be behind the behavior.

##### 3. Translate to Code

- After returning, choose one observation.
- Create a p5.js sketch that simulates the behavior or structure you observed.
- Use code as a tool to understand, model, and reimagine natural processes.


#### Deliverable

- A short blog-style documentation (with images/video)
- A p5.js sketch simulating your chosen natural pattern
- A reflection on what you observed and how you interpreted it
