title: Excursion into the Nature of Code
description: Based on https://natureofcode.com/ by Daniel Shiffmann

#### Objective

During our excursion to the island, your task is to closely observe patterns, behaviors, and systems in nature. These can include the movement of birds or insects, wave patterns, plant growth, weather changes, animal flocking, erosion, or other emergent phenomena.

  

#### Your Mission:

##### 1. Observe

- Spend time in nature.
- Watch how things move, grow, repeat, or interact.
- Focus on patterns that emerge over time or through interaction.

##### 2. Document

- Take notes, sketches, videos, or photos.
- Describe what you see in simple terms (e.g. "many birds change direction together", "branches grow in spirals").
- Think about what rules might be behind the behavior.

##### 3. Translate to Code

- After returning, choose one observation.
- Create a p5.js sketch that simulates the behavior or structure you observed.
- Use code as a tool to understand, model, and reimagine natural processes.

  

#### Tips

- Don't aim for realism--aim for logic.
- Focus on the rules behind the patterns.
- Think in terms of systems, repetition, randomness, and interaction.
- Remember you can use AI to generate the code but you still need to understand it (let AI explain it)

  

#### Deliverable

- A short blog-style documentation (with images/video)
- A p5.js sketch simulating your chosen natural pattern
- A reflection on what you observed and how you interpreted it
