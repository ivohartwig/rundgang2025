# Project Briefing: Text, the Universal Interface

  
An exploration of what can be achieved with text and APIs using large language models.

  

## Your Mission

Ideate and prototype a speculative, beautiful, useless, meaningful, intricate, text-based application/game/art work/story as a web-based project that interacts with users by feeding their input to a large language model.
Inputs might include clicks, typed answers, video feeds, audio, uploaded images, real-time weather data[0], geolocation[1], or other sources.

### 1. Warm-up


Research large language models, generate ideas, and experiment with example applications.

- Explore how different LLM APIs (like OpenAI, Cohere, or open-source models) are used
- Create multiple small prototypes based on different input modalities (text, image, location, etc.)
- Collect references and inspiration from existing projects
- Learn about prompt engineering 

### 2. The Zone

Build your concept. Focus on functionality and interaction before styling.

- Implement the core logic of your project
- Connect input(s) to the language models API
- Map out and refine your data flow and user interactions

  

### 3. Finishing Touches

Polish your project. Add design, fix bugs, and test usability.

- Improve visual and interaction design
- Write help or onboarding texts for users
- Conduct tests with friends/family and fix edge cases

  

## Tips

- Start small, iterate fast
- Prompt engineering is the key
- Use environment variables for your API keys if needed
- Document your code
- Does your prompt pass the "knock knock" test?

  

## Deliverables

- A fully functional webpage with your prototype 
- A README.md explaining your concept, tech stack, and how to use it
- A LICENSE file specifying how others may use your work
