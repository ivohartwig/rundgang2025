title: Teachable Machine
description: Using teachable machine to train an AI to recognize objects, sounds, or poses.
---


We created interactive websites that use AI models trained with Teachable Machine to recognize objects, sounds, or poses and respond to human input. The process began with experimenting on the Teachable Machine platform, exploring what types of input worked best, and learning how to display results using JavaScript or p5.js. We brainstormed creative ideas, then focused on a single concept to develop further.

During implementation, we iteratively built and debugged our site, paying close attention to user experience and interface design. The final product was a polished, unique website published on GitHub Pages, accompanied by a README with images and a clear explanation of the project, as well as a proper license.

#### Objective

This project will websites that use AI trained with Teachable Machine to interact with humans. 

#### Your Mission:

##### 1. Experiment with Teachable Machine

- Learn how to train your AI
- What works good what does not work
- Generate ideas using pose, sound, images
- Learn how to display the result using Javascript/p5.js
- Find one path you want to follow

##### 2. Implementation

- hack hack hack
- LOOK FOR BUGS AND ERRORS IN THE DEVELOPER CONSOLE!
- Use AI to fix these bugs (but still understand the code, this is crucial)
- Think also of UX (user experience) and UI (user interface) how will someone user your site

##### 3. Presentation

- Polish up your site
- Test it with friends and family (ask them if they understand
- Find edge cases

#### Tips

- Don't forget the magic. If the user sees the videofeed it is less magic 
- Go beyond a simple I show you an image you tell me what it is.
- What can the site do with the result?
- Tell a story
- Play a game
- Make the user wonder
- Be funny
- Be useless


#### Deliverable:
- A unique site on GitHub pages for your project 
- A README.md in the repo that explains your project with some images 
- A LICENSE for your project https://choosealicense.com
