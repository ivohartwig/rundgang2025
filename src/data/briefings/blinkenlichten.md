title: Blinkenlichten
description: A Physical Computing Project about blinking lights using Arduino by classic hacker culture, LEDs, and the art of interaction
---


We designed and built an interactive object that uses sensors to detect environmental input—such as motion, sound, or distance—and responds with expressive blinking lights. Our focus was on creating a visually cohesive and mysterious device, concealing the underlying technology to highlight the light effects. The process involved researching sensor types, brainstorming concepts, sketching ideas, and carefully selecting materials to achieve the desired visual impact.

We connected sensors to an Arduino, programmed the device to react to sensor input, and iterated on both the enclosure design and LED behavior. The final result was a polished, exhibition-ready object with reactive light patterns, accompanied by a short video demonstration, a concise write-up explaining its function and behavior, and complete documentation of the code and wiring.

<!-- 
#### Objective

##### 1. Exploration & Concept

- Research sensor types and microcontroller basics
- Brainstorm: what can your object sense?
- Think visually: how will it blink, glow, pulse, or flicker?
- Sketch your idea and consider materials

##### 2. Build & Program

- Connect your sensor(s) to an Arduino
- Write code to react to sensor input (start simple)
- Design the enclosure: no visible electronics!
- Iterate on interaction and LED behavior
- Test in semi-darkness: how does it feel?

##### 3. Finalize & Exhibit

- Align with class style (colors, materials, visual theme)
- Film a short video of your object in action
- Prepare for exhibition (label, setup, stability)
- Bring cookies if you want extra credit

#### Deliverables

- A working object with reactive light behavior
- A short video demo (1–2 minutes)
- A brief write-up: what does it sense? how does it behave?
- Your code and wiring sketch (in your GitHub repo)
- Your object ready for exhibition
